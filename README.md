# Malaria Research

This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers, policymakers, and public health professionals working on malaria surveillance, modeling, and intervention strategies. It provides open-access R code, datasets (if allowed by our collaborators and data providers), reports, and statistical models that analyze malaria transmission patterns in Western Kenya, particularly in Siaya County.
